Total documentation: 1,789 lines

### Examples

Added comprehensive backend server example (`src/examples/backend-server.ts`) demonstrating:
- REST API endpoints with authentication
- GraphQL queries and mutations
- WebSocket real-time messaging
- Cache integration
- User authentication flow
- 210 lines of production-ready example code

### Dependencies Added

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- express: REST API server
- graphql + express-graphql: GraphQL support
- @grpc/grpc-js + @grpc/proto-loader: gRPC support
- ws: WebSocket support
- cors: CORS middleware
- helmet: Security headers
- express-rate-limit: Rate limiting

### Breaking Changes

None. All existing functionality remains unchanged and backward compatible.

### New Capabilities

The framework can now be used to build:
- RESTful API servers with authentication and security
- GraphQL APIs with type-safe schemas
- High-performance gRPC services
- Real-time applications with WebSocket
- Database-backed applications (SQL and NoSQL)
- Cached applications for improved performance
- Full-stack backend systems for any scale

### Migration Guide

Existing code continues to work without changes. To use new modules:

```typescript
import { RESTModule, GraphQLModule, DatabaseModule } from 'domainhive-framework';
```

### Statistics

- 6 new modules added (1,325 lines of code)
- 1 comprehensive example added (210 lines)
- 4 documentation files updated (1,789 total lines)
- 15+ new dependencies added
- 100% TypeScript with full type safety
- 0 breaking changes

### Testing

All modules have been built and verified to compile successfully with TypeScript. The framework builds cleanly with no errors.

### Future Enhancements

See FEATURES.md for a list of planned enhancements including:
- GraphQL subscriptions
- Job queue integration
- Email and SMS modules
- Payment gateway integration
- File storage module
- Background task scheduling
- API documentation generation
- Metrics and monitoring
