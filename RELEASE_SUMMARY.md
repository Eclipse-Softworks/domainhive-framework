## Next Steps - Manual Actions Required

Due to authentication restrictions in the automated environment, the following steps need to be completed manually:

### Step 1: Push the Tag to GitHub

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will make the tag available on GitHub and trigger any GitHub Actions workflows configured for tags.

### Step 2: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to: https://github.com/Eclipse-Softworks/domainhive-framework/releases/new
2. Select tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: `v1.0.0 - Enterprise Backend System`
4. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md or use the tag message
5. Check "Set as the latest release"
6. Click "Publish release"

### Step 3: Publish to npm

```bash
# Login to npm (if not already logged in)
npm login

# Publish the package
npm publish
```

Or use the automated script:

```bash
npm run release
```

### Step 4: Verify the Release

1. **npm**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/domainhive-framework
2. **GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/Eclipse-Softworks/domainhive-framework/releases
3. **Test installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install domainhive-framework@1.0.0
   ```
